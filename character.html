        <p>King Boo is an enemy and boss from the Mario series, and the main antagonist and final boss of the Luigi's Mansion series. He is the king of all the Boos and ghosts and the archenemy of Luigi. His most prominent ally is the Koopa King Bowser, who has aided King Boo in his various schemes. He is more than capable of devising and enacting villainous plans by himself, including his capture and imprisonment of Mario. Although not the biggest Boo, King Boo has abilities that far surpass that of the average ghost; he wields a number of impressive magical abilities, including the ability to materialize objects. King Boo's magical power is directly proportional to the number of Boos in his vicinity.</p>
